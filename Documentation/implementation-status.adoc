== Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the current implementation status of the SmartBook project. The codebase has been generated with initial structure and build system, ready for testing and iterative development.

== Build System

=== Status: Complete

The build system is fully implemented and tested:

* **Top-level Makefile:** Orchestrates builds across all components
* **CMake Configuration:** All components have CMakeLists.txt files
* **Platform Support:** macOS, Linux, and Windows
* **Qt Auto-Detection:** Automatically finds Qt installations
* **Dependency Checking:** Scripts to verify required dependencies
* **Install Targets:** Support for installation with configurable prefix

=== Build Targets

* `make macos` / `make linux` / `.\build-windows.ps1` - Build all components
* `make test` - Build and run tests
* `make docs` - Generate documentation PDFs
* `make install` - Install binaries (Unix/macOS)
* `make run-reader` / `make run-creator` - Run applications

== Source Code Structure

=== Common Library (`common/`)

**Status:** Initial structure created

**Components:**
* `database/LocalDBManager` - Local SQLite database management
* `database/CartridgeDBConnector` - Cartridge database connections
* `security/SignatureVerifier` - 4-phase verification algorithm
* `security/TrustRegistry` - Trust registry management
* `utils/PlatformUtils` - Platform detection and path resolution
* `utils/PathUtils` - Path manipulation utilities
* `metadata/MetadataExtractor` - Cartridge metadata extraction

**Implementation Level:** Basic structure with TODO markers for full implementation

=== Reader Application (`reader/`)

**Status:** Initial structure created

**Components:**
* `LibraryManager` - Main window and library management
* `ReaderViewWindow` - Individual cartridge viewing window
* `WebChannelBridge` - IPC between JavaScript and C++
* `ui/LibraryView` - Library list display
* `ui/ReaderView` - Content rendering widget
* `ui/ConsentDialog` - Security consent dialog

**Implementation Level:** Basic structure with TODO markers for full implementation

=== Creator Tool (`creator/`)

**Status:** Initial structure created

**Components:**
* `CreatorMainWindow` - Main application window
* `ContentEditor` - HTML content editor
* `FormBuilder` - Form definition builder
* `CartridgeExporter` - Cartridge creation and signing
* `ui/MainWindow` - UI components

**Implementation Level:** Basic structure with TODO markers for full implementation

=== Test Suite (`test/`)

**Status:** Initial structure created

**Components:**
* `unit/` - Unit tests (Qt Test framework)
* `integration/` - Integration tests
* `CMakeLists.txt` - Test build configuration

**Implementation Level:** Basic structure with example unit test

== Next Steps

=== Phase 1: Build Verification

. [x] Build system setup
. [ ] Verify common library builds
. [ ] Verify reader builds
. [ ] Verify creator builds
. [ ] Verify tests build

=== Phase 2: Basic Functionality

. [ ] Implement database initialization
. [ ] Implement basic UI components
. [ ] Implement cartridge loading
. [ ] Implement content rendering

=== Phase 3: Core Features

. [ ] Implement library management
. [ ] Implement security verification
. [ ] Implement form handling
. [ ] Implement custom navigation

=== Phase 4: Testing

. [ ] Unit tests for common library
. [ ] Integration tests for reader
. [ ] Integration tests for creator
. [ ] Platform-specific testing

== Known Issues

None at this time. Issues will be documented as they are discovered during testing.

== TODO Markers

The codebase contains TODO markers indicating areas that need implementation:

* Database schema creation
* Security verification implementation
* UI component implementation
* Form handling
* Cartridge export
* Error handling
* Logging

These will be addressed incrementally with atomic commits during the testing phase.
