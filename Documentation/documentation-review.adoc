== Executive Summary

The documentation is generally well-structured and comprehensive for the Reader application, but several significant gaps exist, particularly around the Creator Tool, embedded applications, error handling, and some cross-document inconsistencies. This review identifies these issues for resolution.

== CRITICAL GAPS

=== Creator Tool Specifications [OK] RESOLVED (Subject to Review)

**Issue:** The Creator Tool is mentioned in Product Concept and has a packaging algorithm in DDD, but lacks comprehensive requirements and design specifications.

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - A comprehensive Creator Tool requirements section (FR-CT-3.1 through FR-CT-3.73) has been added to the SRS document, covering:
* Functional Requirements: 73 requirements covering content authoring, page management, stylesheet management, JavaScript/embedded apps, form definitions, metadata, resources, search, cartridge creation/export, auto-save, draft/publishing, templates, import, version history, error recovery, accessibility, and multi-language support
* Workflow Specifications: Cartridge creation, editing, validation, signing, and export workflows specified
* Certificate Management: Requirements for managing certificates and signing at three trust levels (FR-CT-3.32, FR-CT-3.33)
* Export/Publish Process: Complete export and publishing workflow specified (FR-CT-3.34, FR-CT-3.40-3.43)
* Error Handling: Error recovery and data integrity requirements specified (FR-CT-3.58-3.62)

**Note:** Requirements are comprehensive but may be refined or expanded during detailed analysis and design phases. UI/UX design details will be specified in the DDD.

**Recommendation:** ~~Create a dedicated "Creator Tool SRS" document or add a comprehensive section to the existing SRS.~~ **COMPLETED** - Requirements added to main SRS. Review during design phase recommended.

=== Embedded Applications Schema and Execution [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Inconsistent references to embedded app storage and execution mechanism.

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - The embedded application concept and schema have been fully specified:

. **Schema Defined:** Complete `Embedded_Apps` table schema added to DDD Section 3 with columns: `app_id`, `app_name`, `manifest_json`, `entry_html`, `js_code`, `css_code`, `additional_resources`

. **Manifest Structure Clarified:** `Embedded_App_Manifest` JSON is stored in the `manifest_json` column of the `Embedded_Apps` table, resolving the storage location question

. **Concept Clarified:** Embedded apps are defined as Single Page Applications (SPAs) or similar interactive components that operate **locally only** with **no network access**, providing functionality like character generators, design tools, calculators, etc.

. **Security Model Specified:** 
+

* Local operation only (no network access)
* Sandboxed file system access (scoped to `{cartridge_guid}/{app_id}/sandbox/`)
* Isolated execution context
* Sandbox file system API added to WebChannel API specification

. **Execution Flow Documented:** Complete 7-step execution flow specified in DDD, including app loading, sandbox creation, resource injection, and isolation

. **Sandbox API Added:** Four new WebChannel API methods added: `saveSandboxFile`, `loadSandboxFile`, `listSandboxFiles`, `deleteSandboxFile`

**Recommendation:** ~~Define the complete `Embedded_Apps` table schema in DDD Section 3, clarify the relationship between `Embedded_App_Manifest` JSON and the database table, specify the app loading and execution algorithm in DDD~~ **COMPLETED**

=== Error Handling Specifications [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Error handling is not comprehensively specified across the system.

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive error handling specifications have been added:

. **SRS Requirements Added:** 18 new error handling requirements (FR-ERR-4.1 through FR-ERR-4.18) covering:
+

* Reader application errors (cartridge file, database, signature, file system, manifest, WebEngine)
* Creator Tool errors (content validation, cartridge creation, signing, export, import, resource management)
* Logging requirements (minimal logging, automatic rotation, log format, error reporting)

. **WebChannel API Error Handling:** Complete error handling added for all API methods:
+

* Standard callback pattern with error codes
* Error code categories (validation, security, resource, permission, system)
* Specific error handling for each method (`saveFormData`, `loadFormData`, `requestAppConsent`, sandbox file operations)
* Error logging requirements

. **DDD Error Handling Implementation:** Detailed error handling strategy documented:
+

* Cartridge file error detection and handling
* Database connection error recovery
* Signature verification error messages
* File system error handling
* Manifest update error handling (non-blocking)
* WebEngine error recovery
* Creator Tool validation and export error handling
* Logging implementation details (format, rotation algorithm, log levels, error context)

. **Logging Requirements:**
+

* Minimal logging (errors, warnings, critical security events only)
* Automatic log rotation (10MB or daily, whichever comes first)
* Maximum 5 rotated log files retained
* Platform-appropriate log locations
* Human-readable, machine-parseable format

**Recommendation:** ~~Add comprehensive error handling sections to WebChannel API Specification, DDD (Reader error handling), Creator Tool specifications~~ **COMPLETED**

== INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS

=== Document Version Conflicts [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Two different SRS documents exist with different revision dates:
* `srs.adoc` - FINAL REVISED (2025-12-14)
* `srs-addendum-1.adoc` - FINAL REVISION (2025-12-13)

**Problem:** It's unclear which is the authoritative version or how they relate.

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - The addendum content has been merged into the main `srs.adoc` document. The addendum (`srs-addendum-1.adoc`) has been deleted. The main SRS now contains all requirements with enhanced formatting (rationale columns in NFR section).

**Recommendation:** [line-through]#Consolidate into a single SRS document or clearly document the relationship (e.g., addendum supersedes base, or vice versa).# **COMPLETED**

=== Metadata Schema Differences [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Product Concept shows different metadata fields than DDD:

**Product Concept:**
* `publisher` field mentioned
* `cover_image_path` (path reference)

**DDD:**
* No `publisher` field (author field described as "Author/Publisher name")
* `cover_image_path` exists but relationship to `cover_image_data` in manifest unclear

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - Metadata schema has been aligned:
* **Publisher Field Added:** `publisher` field (TEXT, nullable) added to `Metadata` table in DDD
* **Author Field Clarified:** `author` field now explicitly for author name(s) only
* **Publisher Optional:** Publisher field is nullable to support self-published works
* **Manifest Cache:** `publisher` field added to `Local_Library_Manifest` table for fast queries
* **Bibliographic Accuracy:** Author and publisher are now distinct entities as required for proper bibliographic metadata

**Recommendation:** ~~Align schemas across all documents.~~ **COMPLETED** - Publisher field added to Metadata table, schemas aligned.

=== Settings Table Missing

**Issue:** Product Concept mentions a `Settings` table for book-specific rendering defaults, but:
* Not defined in DDD cartridge schema
* Not referenced in Reader requirements
* No specification for how settings are used

**Recommendation:** Either remove from Product Concept or fully specify in DDD.

[OK] **RESOLVED:** Settings table is now fully specified:
* `Settings` table defined in DDD Section 3 (Cartridge Schema) with columns: `setting_key`, `setting_value`, `setting_type`, `description`
* `Local_User_Settings` table defined in DDD Section 4 (Reader Local Persistence Schema) for user preference overrides
* Reader requirements added: FR-2.2.3, FR-2.2.4, FR-2.6.1 through FR-2.6.5
* Creator Tool requirements added: FR-CT-3.12a through FR-CT-3.12d
* Settings are stored in the cartridge (author-defined) with user overrides stored separately in local database
* Reset functionality preserves original author defaults

== SECURITY GAPS

=== Certificate Management

**Issue:** Security model references CA-signed and self-signed certificates, but:
* No specification for certificate storage/management in Reader
* No specification for certificate revocation checking
* No specification for certificate expiration handling
* No specification for trusted CA list management

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* Added `certificate_data` column to `Cartridge_Security` table schema
* Implemented certificate validation using Qt's `QSslCertificate` with system certificate store integration
* Certificate expiration checking: Expired CA certificates are downgraded to Level 2 (Self-Signed Trust) and require user consent
* Certificate revocation checking deferred for Phase 1 (network access conflicts with offline-first design)
* System certificate store used (Windows Certificate Store, macOS Keychain, Linux CA bundle) - no manual CA list maintenance required
* Detailed certificate validation algorithm documented in DDD Section "Certificate Validation Implementation"

=== Public Key Distribution

**Issue:** DDD mentions `public_key_fingerprint` but:
* No specification for how public keys are distributed
* No specification for public key storage in Reader
* No specification for key rotation/updates

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* Public keys are extracted from X.509 certificates stored in `certificate_data` column - no separate distribution mechanism required
* Public keys are extracted on-demand during signature verification using Qt's `QSslCertificate::publicKey()` - no persistent storage in Reader needed
* Fingerprint verification added: Calculate fingerprint of extracted public key and compare with stored `public_key_fingerprint` to detect tampering
* Key rotation: Each cartridge is self-contained and independent - new cartridges can use new certificates while old cartridges remain valid with original certificates
* Detailed public key extraction, fingerprint verification, storage, and key rotation documented in DDD Section "Public Key Extraction and Fingerprint Verification"

=== Content Hash Algorithm Details

**Issue:** References to H1 and H2 hashes, but:
* Exact hash algorithm not specified (DDD says "e.g., SHA-256")
* Which tables are included in "critical content tables" not fully specified
* Hash calculation order/process not detailed

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Hash Algorithm:** SHA-256 (256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm) - specified as the exact algorithm, not "e.g."
* **Tables Included:** Content_Pages, Embedded_Apps (attack surface), Form_Definitions, Settings, Content_Themes, Metadata (partial - excludes cartridge_guid)
* **Tables Excluded:** User_Data (user input, not author content), Cartridge_Security (circular dependency)
* **Hash Calculation Method:** Option A - Concatenate table hashes (hash each table independently, concatenate with table name prefixes, hash the result)
* **Table Ordering:** Fixed order: Content_Pages, Content_Themes, Embedded_Apps, Form_Definitions, Metadata, Settings
* **Row Ordering:** Ordered by primary key (ascending) within each table
* **Row Serialization:** Columns in alphabetical order, UTF-8 for text, big-endian for integers, raw bytes for BLOBs, NULL marker (0x00), row delimiter (0x0A)
* **Empty Table Handling:** Include empty tables (hash of empty byte array)
* **Detailed Algorithm:** Complete specification with pseudocode documented in DDD Section "Content Hash Algorithm Specification"

=== JavaScript Sandboxing

**Issue:** Embedded JavaScript execution is mentioned, but:
* No specification for JavaScript security sandbox
* No specification for what APIs are available/restricted
* No specification for CSP (Content Security Policy) if applicable
* No specification for preventing access to file system, network, etc.

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Qt WebEngine Native Sandboxing:** Leverages Qt WebEngine's built-in process isolation and V8 JavaScript engine isolation (each app in separate QWebEngineView instance)
* **Network API Restrictions:** All network APIs blocked (fetch, XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, EventSource, external resource loading) via QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor and CSP
* **File System API Restrictions:** Direct file system APIs blocked (File System Access API, FileReader for local files) - all file operations must use WebChannel sandbox API
* **Storage APIs:** Allowed (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB) - isolated per app instance
* **Clipboard APIs:** Allowed (navigator.clipboard) - safe for UX
* **Device Access APIs:** Blocked (geolocation, getUserMedia, battery, vibrate) - not needed, privacy/security risks
* **Window/Navigation APIs:** External navigation blocked (window.open, window.location to external URLs), internal navigation allowed (SPA routing)
* **Communication APIs:** Cross-origin blocked, same-origin allowed (postMessage, BroadcastChannel within app)
* **Worker APIs:** Web Workers allowed (performance), SharedWorkers blocked
* **Evaluation APIs:** Allowed (eval, Function) - required for SPAs, controlled via CSP
* **WebAssembly APIs:** Allowed (compile, instantiate), streaming APIs blocked (require network)
* **Notification APIs:** Allowed (for user notifications)
* **CSP Configuration:** Strict CSP header specified with connect-src 'none', default-src 'self', script-src with unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval for SPA support
* **Network Request Interceptor:** Custom QWebEngineUrlRequestInterceptor implementation specified to block all HTTP/HTTPS requests
* **Security Layers:** Defense in depth with process isolation, network interceptor (primary), CSP (secondary), API restrictions (tertiary), sandbox file system (controlled access)
* Detailed JavaScript Security Sandbox and API Restrictions specification documented in DDD Section "JavaScript Security Sandbox and API Restrictions"

== DATA AND PERSISTENCE GAPS

=== User Data Versioning

**Issue:** Form data persistence is specified, but:
* No handling for form schema changes (what if form definition changes?)
* No migration strategy for user data
* No versioning of saved form data

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Form Versioning:** Added `form_version` column to `Form_Definitions` table, version incremented on breaking changes (field removed/renamed/type changed)
* **Data Version Tracking:** Added `form_version` and `migrated_from_version` columns to `User_Data` table to track data version and migration history
* **Migration Rules:** Added `migration_rules_json` column to `Form_Definitions` table for storing field mapping and transformation rules
* **Form Page Structure:** Forms SHALL be placed on dedicated content pages (not intermingled with content text), form builder output injected at designated points
* **Form Builder Version Management:** Form Builder UI for version management, version increment workflow, migration mapping interface, version history view

* **Form Builder Migration Interface:** Migration mapping dialog with side-by-side field comparison, migration preview with sample data, version history view
* Detailed form versioning and data migration specification documented in DDD Section "Form Versioning and Data Migration"

=== Manifest Update Triggers

**Issue:** DDD mentions manifest updates, but:
* When exactly is manifest updated? (on import, on open, on change?)
* What happens if manifest update fails?
* How are duplicate cartridge_guid handled?

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Two Types of Manifests Clarified:**
  * **Embedded App Manifest** (`Embedded_App_Manifest` JSON): Created/updated when cartridge is created/updated by Creator Tool, stored in `Embedded_Apps.manifest_json` column within cartridge
  * **Local Library Manifest** (`Local_Library_Manifest` table): Updated when cartridge is added/updated/removed from library, stored in Reader's local database

* **Local Library Manifest Update Triggers:**
  * On cartridge import (new cartridge added to library)
  * On cartridge open (content hash H2 recalculated, manifest updated)
  * On cartridge update (cartridge detected at new path or with changed content)
  * On cartridge deletion (manifest entry removed)

* **Error Handling:**
  * **Embedded App Manifest:** Error dialog in Creator Tool with operation type, app ID, error message, context, and suggested resolution. Includes "Copy Error Details" button for debugging.
  * **Local Library Manifest:** Error dialog in Reader with operation type, cartridge info, error message, context (database path, SQLite error code), and suggested resolution. Includes "Copy Error Details" button for debugging. Operations continue (non-blocking), retry on next launch.

* **Error Dialog Requirements:** Both error dialogs include sufficient information to reproduce and debug failures: operation type, affected resource (app ID or cartridge GUID), error type, detailed error message, context (paths, timestamps, error codes), and suggested resolution steps.

* Detailed manifest update lifecycle and error handling documented in DDD Section "Manifest Update Error Handling"

=== Database Migration

**Issue:** No specification for:
* Cartridge format version migration
* Reader database schema migration
* Handling older format cartridges

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Cartridge Format Version Migration:**
  * Version stored in `Metadata.schema_version` field
  * Reader detects version on cartridge open, compares with supported versions
  * Backward compatibility: Reader supports all previous format versions, migration performed in-memory (cartridge files remain unchanged)
  * Forward compatibility: Reader detects newer format versions and displays error requiring application update
  * Migration process: Version detection, compatibility check, in-memory transformation, validation
  * Format version changes: Breaking changes require MAJOR version increment, non-breaking changes require MINOR increment
  * Migration transformations: Table schema migrations (add/remove/rename columns, add/remove tables, data type changes), data transformations (JSON structure changes, encoding changes, default values)
  * Migration error handling: Error dialogs with details, logging, partial migration warnings, migration validation

* **Reader Local Database Schema Migration:**
  * Version tracking via `_schema_version` table in local database
  * Migration on startup: Version detection, migration path determination, backup creation, sequential transformations, version update, validation
  * Migration transformations: Add/remove columns (using table recreation for SQLite limitations), add/remove tables, modify constraints
  * Migration backup: Automatic backup before migration (`local_reader.sqlite.backup`), restore on failure
  * Migration error handling: Restore from backup on failure, error dialogs, validation, user notification
  * Schema version history: Version 1.0 (Phase 1) documented, future versions to be documented as introduced

* **Handling Older Format Cartridges:**
  * Detection via `schema_version` field
  * Loading strategy: Supported older versions (migrate and load), unsupported older versions (error message), newer versions (error requiring app update)
  * User experience: Transparent automatic migration, notification only on failure or unsupported format
  * Creator Tool compatibility: Can open/migrate older formats, can save in current format, optional save in older formats for testing

* Detailed database migration strategy documented in DDD Section "Database Migration Strategy"

== UI/UX GAPS

=== Library Manager Import Process

**Issue:** Import is mentioned but not detailed:
* How users import cartridges (drag-drop, file dialog, etc.)
* Import validation and error messages
* Import progress indication
* Handling duplicate imports

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Import Mechanisms:** Drag-and-drop support (drop cartridge files onto Library Manager window) and file picker dialog (File → Import menu or toolbar button, supports single or multiple file selection)
* **Import Storage Location:** Default library directory follows OS standards (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\SmartBook\Library\`, macOS/Linux: `~/Documents/SmartBook/Library/`), user-configurable custom library directory via settings, preference persists across sessions
* **Import Progress Dialog:** Progress bar showing overall progress, status text for current operation, file list with status indicators (pending, in progress, completed, failed), cancel button to abort import
* **Duplicate Detection:** Detects duplicates by comparing `cartridge_guid`, displays confirmation dialog with existing and new cartridge information (title, author, file path, size, modification date), user options: Replace (delete old, import new, update manifest), Skip (abort import for this cartridge), Keep Both (rename new file, import as separate entry), checkbox for batch handling ("Apply this choice to all duplicates")
* **Import Validation:** File format validation (SQLite database, required tables), schema validation (Metadata table, cartridge_guid, schema_version), version compatibility check, metadata extraction (title, author, publication_year, cover image), error dialogs for validation failures
* **Import Workflow:** Complete algorithm specified: file selection, progress dialog display, process each file (validate, check duplicate, copy file, extract metadata, create manifest entry), completion, error summary
* **Import Error Handling:** File access errors (not found, permission denied, disk full), database errors (invalid format, locked, corruption), manifest update errors, comprehensive logging
* Detailed import process specification documented in DDD Section "Cartridge Import Process Specification"

=== Reader View Window Management

**Issue:** Multi-window architecture is specified, but:
* How users open new windows
* Window closing behavior
* Window state persistence (size, position)
* Minimize/restore behavior

**Status:** `[OK] RESOLVED`

**Resolution:**
* **Window Opening Mechanisms:**
  * **Double-Click:** Double-clicking cartridge title (List View) or cover (Grid View) opens cartridge in new Reader View Window
  * **Context Menu:** Right-clicking cartridge title or cover displays context menu with "Open" option, follows platform conventions (Calibre, Apple Books pattern)
  * Visual feedback on double-click, immediate window opening (no confirmation)

* **Window State Persistence:**
  * **New Table:** `Local_Window_State` table stores window geometry (width, height, x, y), maximized state, and last updated timestamp per cartridge
  * **Save Trigger:** Window state saved when Reader View Window is closed (user closes window or application quits)
  * **Components Saved:** Window size, window position, maximized state, reading position (in `Local_Reading_Position` table)
  * **Atomic Save:** Window state and reading position saved in same transaction

* **Window State Restoration:**
  * **Restore Trigger:** When cartridge is opened, query `Local_Window_State` and `Local_Reading_Position` tables
  * **Restore Components:** Window size, window position, maximized state, reading position (page, anchor, scroll)
  * **Validation:** Validate saved geometry (screen bounds, reasonable size), fallback to defaults if invalid
  * **Default Geometry:** 1024x768 pixels centered on screen (or 80% of screen size)
  * **Multi-Monitor Handling:** If saved position on non-existent monitor, move to primary monitor and center

* **Window Minimize/Restore:**
  * Follow standard OS conventions (Windows taskbar, macOS Dock, Linux taskbar/panel)
  * Use Qt standard window management (`showMinimized()`, `showNormal()`, `showMaximized()`)
  * Minimized state NOT persisted (transient), normal/maximized state IS persisted
  * Window state transitions: Normal ↔ Minimized, Normal ↔ Maximized, Maximized ↔ Minimized

=== Performance Testing [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Only library load performance is specified:
* No performance requirements for:
** Cartridge opening
** Form data save/load
** Content rendering
** Search operations

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - Pragmatic performance testing strategy defined:

* **Performance Testing Philosophy:**
  * Acknowledge that as a native desktop application using SQLite, most operations will be near-instantaneous (< 100ms)
  * Focus performance testing on scenarios where degradation is possible or measurable
  * Use user-perceived performance thresholds (what feels slow to a user) rather than arbitrary technical metrics
  * Emphasize regression testing (ensuring performance doesn't degrade over time) over absolute thresholds for most operations

* **Specific Performance Requirements (Where Measurable and Meaningful):**
  * **Library Load (NFR-3.1):** 500ms for 100+ cartridges - Already specified and testable (T-UI-01)
  * **Search Performance (FR-2.9.8):** < 2 seconds for 100+ pages - Already specified with optional indexing/caching

* **Performance Testing Strategy:**
  * **Near-Instantaneous Operations (No Specific Thresholds):**
    * Cartridge opening (SQLite file open is typically < 50ms)
    * Form data save/load (single-row SQLite operations are < 10ms)
    * Content rendering (HTML rendering is typically < 100ms for typical pages)
    * Page navigation (SQLite queries are < 10ms)
    * Metadata operations (all use indexed SQLite queries)
    * **Testing Approach:** Verify operations complete without noticeable delay (< 200ms is acceptable for user-perceived "instant"). Focus on regression testing to ensure performance doesn't degrade.

  * **Operations with Measurable Performance Characteristics:**
    * **Library Load:** 500ms threshold for 100+ cartridges (NFR-3.1, T-UI-01)
    * **Search Operations:** < 2 seconds for 100+ pages (FR-2.9.8)
    * **Large Cartridge Opening:** Test with very large cartridges (1000+ pages, 100MB+ database) to ensure reasonable performance
    * **Concurrent Operations:** Test multiple windows/operations simultaneously to identify contention issues

  * **Performance Regression Testing:**
    * Establish baseline performance metrics during initial development
    * Re-test periodically to ensure performance doesn't degrade with code changes
    * Focus on operations that could be impacted by new features or refactoring

  * **Stress Testing (Identify Breaking Points):**
    * Very large cartridges (1000+ pages, large embedded resources)
    * Many simultaneous Reader windows (5+ open cartridges)
    * Large library (500+ cartridges in manifest)
    * **Goal:** Identify performance degradation points, not set strict thresholds

* **Performance Test Cases Added:**
  * T-PERF-01: Library Load Performance (NFR-3.1) - 500ms for 100+ cartridges
  * T-PERF-02: Search Performance (FR-2.9.8) - < 2 seconds for 100+ pages
  * T-PERF-03: Large Cartridge Opening - Verify reasonable performance with 1000+ page cartridge
  * T-PERF-04: Concurrent Window Operations - Multiple windows open simultaneously
  * T-PERF-05: Large Library Performance - 500+ cartridges in library

* **Rationale:**
  * Native desktop apps with SQLite are inherently fast for typical operations
  * Setting arbitrary thresholds for near-instantaneous operations is not meaningful
  * User-perceived performance (feels instant) is more important than microsecond measurements
  * Focus should be on identifying actual performance problems (regressions, large datasets) rather than optimizing already-fast operations
  * SQLite performance is well-understood and predictable for typical use cases

**Recommendation:** ~~Add comprehensive performance requirements and tests.~~ **COMPLETED** - Pragmatic performance testing strategy defined focusing on measurable scenarios and regression testing.

== PHASE 2 PREPARATION GAPS

=== User Identity [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** Phase 2 mentions multi-user, but Phase 1:
* `User_Data` table has `user_id` field mentioned in Product Concept but not in DDD
* No user identity model for Phase 1
* Unclear if Phase 1 is truly single-user or just local-only

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive Phase 2 User Identity and Authentication specification has been created:

  * Rate limiting on login and password reset
  * Password hashing (Bcrypt/Argon2id)
  * HTTPS-only communication
  * Token security best practices

* **Phase 1 Clarification:**
  * Phase 1 is local-only, single-user (no user identity required)
  * `user_id` field in `User_Data` table reserved for Phase 2
  * Phase 1 operates without user authentication
  * Phase 2 introduces user identity for remote library access

**Recommendation:** ~~Clarify user model for Phase 1 and Phase 2 transition.~~ **COMPLETED** - Complete Phase 2 User Identity and Authentication specification created, Phase 1 clarified as local-only single-user.

=== Remote Library Integration [OK] RESOLVED

**Issue:** `location_status` field exists but:
* No specification for how it's used in Phase 1

**Status:** [OK] **RESOLVED** - Comprehensive Phase 2 Remote Library Integration specification has been created:

* **Multiple Remote Library Support:** Users can configure and use multiple remote libraries simultaneously, each with independent configuration, authentication, and sync settings

* **Location Status Tracking:**
  * `local_only` - Phase 1 default, manually imported cartridges
  * `remote_only` - Available on remote library, not downloaded locally
  * `both` - Exists both locally and remotely (synced)

  * `Sync_Log` table for sync history

* **Security:**
  * Encrypted credential storage per library
  * Token refresh support per library
  * Secure authentication handling
  * Offline support and error handling

* **Phase 1 Usage:**
  * `location_status` defaults to `local_only` for Phase 1
  * All Phase 1 cartridges are local-only
  * Backward compatible with existing Phase 1 functionality

**Recommendation:** ~~Document Phase 1 usage and Phase 2 requirements.~~ **COMPLETED** - Complete Phase 2 Remote Library Integration specification created with multiple library support.
