=== Cartridge

The primary file format for SmartBook content. A cartridge is a single SQLite database file (`.sqlite`) that contains all content, metadata, form definitions, embedded applications, user data, and security information. Cartridges are self-contained and portable.

**Key Characteristics:**
* Single-file format (SQLite database)
* Contains HTML content, metadata, forms, embedded apps
* Includes digital signatures and content hashes for security
* Supports persistent user data storage
* Identified by a unique `cartridge_guid` (UUID v4)

See also: <<Cartridge GUID>>, <<SQLite>>

=== Cartridge GUID

A UUID Version 4 string that serves as the definitive, immutable unique identifier for a cartridge. The `cartridge_guid` is stored in the `Metadata` table and is used throughout the system for identification, trust management, and manifest tracking.

**Format:** UUID v4 (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)

See also: <<Cartridge>>, <<Metadata>>

=== CartridgeDBConnector

A C++ class that manages the database connection and transactional persistence for a specific cartridge file. Each Reader View Instance has its own `CartridgeDBConnector` instance, ensuring data isolation between simultaneously open cartridges.

**Pattern:** Per-Instance (one per open cartridge)

**Responsibilities:**
* Open and manage SQLite connection to cartridge file
* Execute transactions for form data saves
* Provide read access to cartridge content
* Handle database errors and integrity checks

See also: <<Reader View Instance>>, <<LocalDBManager>>

=== CA (Certificate Authority)

A trusted third-party organization that issues digital certificates. Cartridges signed with a valid, non-expired CA certificate are classified as Level 1 (Commercial Trust) and are whitelisted by default.

See also: <<Level 1>>, <<Digital Signature>>

=== Code Signing

The process of digitally signing executable files and applications to verify their authenticity and integrity. SmartBook applications are code-signed on platforms that support it (Windows, macOS) for security and distribution trust.

**Platforms:**
* **Windows:** Code signing certificate (optional but recommended)
* **macOS:** Code signing and notarization (required for distribution outside App Store)
* **Linux:** GPG signing for packages (optional but recommended)

=== Content Security Policy (CSP)

An HTTP header mechanism used to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. In SmartBook, CSP headers are set for embedded applications to restrict network access and prevent malicious behavior.

**CSP Policy for Embedded Apps:**
```
default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
connect-src 'none';
```

See also: <<Form Definition>>, <<User Data>>

=== 4-Phase Verification Algorithm

The security algorithm executed by the Signature Verifier to determine the effective trust policy for a cartridge. The algorithm consists of four phases:

1. **Identity:** Read `cartridge_guid` and security data (H1) from cartridge
2. **Integrity Check:** Recalculate H2 (content hash) and compare H1 vs. H2
3. **Trust Lookup:** Query `Local_Trust_Registry` for existing trust decision
4. **Policy Determination:** Determine effective trust policy based on signature level, integrity check, and trust registry

See also: <<H1>>, <<H2>>, <<Signature Verifier>>, <<Effective Trust Policy>>
