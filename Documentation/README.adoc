== Overview

SmartBook is a cross-platform digital reading and content creation system designed for secure, self-contained content distribution. The system uses SQLite-based "cartridges" that contain both content and metadata, with built-in security verification.

== Key Features

* **Secure Content Distribution:** 4-phase verification algorithm for cartridge integrity
* **Cross-Platform:** Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows
* **Self-Contained:** Cartridges include all content and metadata in SQLite format
* **Creator Tools:** Built-in tools for creating and managing cartridges
* **Form Support:** Interactive forms with data persistence
* **Custom Navigation:** Support for custom navigation structures in collections
