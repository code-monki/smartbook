== Getting Started

=== Step 1: Check Dependencies

Before building, verify all required dependencies are installed:

**macOS/Linux:**
[source,bash]
----
./check-dependencies.sh
----

**Windows:**
[source,powershell]
----
.\check-dependencies.ps1
----

This will check for:
* CMake 3.20+
* C++ compiler (clang/g++ on Unix, MSVC/MinGW on Windows)
* Qt 6.2+ with required components
* SQLite
* Documentation tools (optional)

Install any missing dependencies before proceeding.

=== Step 2: Initial Build

Start with building just the common library to verify the build system works:

**macOS:**
[source,bash]
----
cd common
make
----

**Linux:**
[source,bash]
----
cd common
make
----

**Windows:**
[source,powershell]
----
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target common
----

**Expected Result:** Common library should build successfully. If there are errors, fix them one at a time with atomic commits.

=== Step 3: Build All Components

Once common library builds successfully, build everything:

**macOS:**
[source,bash]
----
make macos
----

**Linux:**
[source,bash]
----
make linux
----

**Windows:**
[source,powershell]
----
.\build-windows.ps1
----

**Expected Result:** All components (common, reader, creator) should build.

=== Step 4: Run Basic Tests

Test the build system and basic functionality:

**macOS/Linux:**
[source,bash]
----
make test-build
----

**Windows:**
[source,powershell]
----
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target test
----

**Expected Result:** Test suite should compile (may not pass yet, but should build).

=== Step 5: Try Running Applications

Attempt to run the applications (they may not work fully yet, but should launch):

**macOS/Linux:**
[source,bash]
----
make run-reader
# or
make run-creator
----

**Windows:**
[source,powershell]
----
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target run-reader
# or
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target run-creator
----

**Expected Result:** Applications should launch (may show empty windows or errors, but should not crash immediately).

== Testing Workflow

=== For Each Issue Found:

. **Identify the Problem**
   * What component? (common, reader, creator)
   * What's the error message?
   * Can you reproduce it consistently?

. **Create Atomic Fix**
   * Fix ONE thing at a time
   * Test the fix in isolation
   * Commit with descriptive message:
   +
   [source,text]
   ----
   fix(<component>): <brief description>
   
   <detailed explanation>
   ----

. **Verify Fix**
   * Rebuild affected component
   * Test the specific functionality
   * Ensure no regressions

. **Commit**
   [source,bash]
   ----
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit  # Will use template
   ----

=== Example Workflow:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Build and find error
make macos
# Error: Missing include in LocalDBManager.cpp

# 2. Fix the issue
# Edit common/src/database/LocalDBManager.cpp
# Add missing #include

# 3. Test the fix
cd common
make clean
make
# Should build successfully

# 4. Commit atomically
git add common/src/database/LocalDBManager.cpp
git commit
# Enter: fix(common): Add missing QSqlQuery include in LocalDBManager
----

== Common Issues to Watch For

=== Build Issues:
* Missing includes
* Incorrect CMake configuration
* Qt component not found
* Linker errors
* Platform-specific issues

=== Runtime Issues:
* Application crashes on startup
* Missing Qt plugins
* Database initialization failures
* Path resolution problems

=== Test Issues:
* Tests don't compile
* Tests fail
* Missing test dependencies

== Testing Priorities

=== Phase 1: Build System
. [x] Dependencies check
. [ ] Common library builds
. [ ] Reader builds
. [ ] Creator builds
. [ ] Tests build

=== Phase 2: Basic Functionality
. [ ] Applications launch without crashing
. [ ] Database initialization works
. [ ] Basic UI displays
. [ ] No immediate crashes

=== Phase 3: Core Features
. [ ] Library management
. [ ] Cartridge loading
. [ ] Content display
. [ ] Form handling

== Atomic Commit Examples

=== Good Atomic Commits:

[source,text]
----
fix(common): Add missing QSqlQuery include in LocalDBManager.cpp

The LocalDBManager was using QSqlQuery without including
the necessary header, causing compilation errors.

fix(reader): Resolve null pointer in LibraryManager constructor

Added null check before accessing QApplication instance.

feat(common): Implement basic database schema creation

Added SQL schema for Local_Library_Manifest table with
proper indexes and constraints.

test(common): Add unit tests for LocalDBManager

Added test cases for:
- Database initialization
- Schema creation
- Query execution
----

=== Avoid:

[source,text]
----
# Bad: Multiple unrelated changes
fix(common): Fix includes and update reader UI and add tests

# Good: Separate commits
fix(common): Add missing includes
feat(reader): Update library view UI
test(common): Add LocalDBManager tests
----

== Next Steps After Initial Build

Once you have a successful build:

. **Document Build Issues**
   * Create issues or notes for any problems encountered
   * Document workarounds

. **Start Implementing TODOs**
   * The codebase has TODO markers for incomplete features
   * Implement them one at a time with atomic commits

. **Add Unit Tests**
   * Start with common library components
   * Test database operations
   * Test utility functions

. **Test Platform-Specific Features**
   * Path resolution
   * Platform utilities
   * Security features

== Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

. Check the error message carefully
. Review the relevant source files
. Check CMake configuration
. Verify dependencies are correct
. Look for similar issues in the codebase
. Commit any fixes atomically

== Quick Reference

[source,bash]
----
# Check dependencies
./check-dependencies.sh          # Unix/macOS
.\check-dependencies.ps1         # Windows

# Build
make macos                       # macOS
make linux                       # Linux
.\build-windows.ps1              # Windows

# Run
make run-reader                  # Unix/macOS
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target run-reader  # Windows

# Test
make test-build                  # Unix/macOS
.\build-windows.ps1 -Target test # Windows

# Clean
make clean                       # Unix/macOS
# Windows: Delete build\ directory
----

Good luck with testing! Remember: one fix, one commit, one test at a time.
