# SmartBook Commit Message Guidelines
# 
# During testing phase, use atomic commits for easier regression tracking:
#
# Format:
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# Types:
# - fix: Bug fix
# - feat: New feature
# - test: Test-related changes
# - build: Build system changes
# - docs: Documentation changes
# - refactor: Code refactoring
# - style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
# - perf: Performance improvements
#
# Examples:
#
# fix(reader): Resolve crash when opening empty cartridge
# 
# Fixed null pointer dereference in LibraryManager when cartridge
# metadata is missing. Added validation before accessing metadata fields.
#
# test(common): Add unit tests for LocalDBManager
#
# Added test cases for:
# - Database initialization
# - Schema creation
# - Query execution
# - Error handling
#
# feat(creator): Add form builder UI
#
# Implemented form builder dialog with drag-and-drop interface.
# Supports JSON schema generation and validation.
